## Basic Import

Once installed, import **dartwork-mpl** alongside matplotlib. The package is typically imported as `dm` for convenience.

```{code-block} python
:caption: example.py

import dartwork_mpl as dm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Apply a style preset (Recommended)
dm.style.use('scientific')  # Academic papers
```

Available presets (from `presets.json`) are:
- `scientific`, `investment`, `presentation`
- `scientific-kr`, `investment-kr`, `presentation-kr`

Each preset layers one or more of the bundled styles from `asset/mplstyle`
(e.g., `base`, `dmpl`, `dmpl_light`, `font-*`, `lang-kr`). See the
[Usage Guide](../usage_guide/index.md) for the exact mappings.

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that **dartwork-mpl** is properly installed and accessible:

```{code-block} python
:caption: verify.py

import dartwork_mpl as dm

# Check installed version
print(dm.__version__)  # Should print something like '0.1.1'

# List all available style files
dm.list_styles()  # ['base', 'dmpl', 'dmpl_light', 'font-investment', ...]

# Verify color palettes are available
print(len(dm.colors.PALETTES))  # Should show available color collections
```

If these commands run without errors, you're all set! 🎉

> **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter import errors, make sure:
> - Your Python environment is activated (if using virtual environments)
> - The package was installed in the correct environment
> - You have matplotlib installed as a dependency

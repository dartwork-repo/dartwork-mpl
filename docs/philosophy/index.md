# Design Philosophy

dartwork-mpl takes a fundamentally different approach from typical visualization libraries. Instead of wrapping matplotlib with a new API layer, we provide **thin utilities** that enhance matplotlib's native capabilities while keeping you in full control.

This document explains the reasoning behind this design and how it benefits both human developers and AI coding agents.

---

## The Problem with Wrapper Libraries

Most visualization libraries aim to reduce boilerplate by providing high-level abstractions:

```python
# Typical high-level library approach
chart = SomeLib.line_chart(
    data=df,
    x='date',
    y='value',
    theme='modern',
    title='My Chart',
    show_legend=True
)
chart.save('output.png')
```

While this looks convenient for simple cases, it creates several problems:

### Additional Abstraction Layers

Every wrapper library introduces a new layer between you and matplotlib. When you need to customize something beyond the library's API:

1. You must understand both the wrapper's API **and** matplotlib's API
2. You need to find escape hatches to access underlying matplotlib objects
3. The wrapper's design decisions may conflict with your requirements

### Diminishing Returns for Custom Visualizations

The more customized your visualization needs to be, the less value these wrappers provide:

```python
# When you need fine-grained control, wrappers become obstacles
chart = SomeLib.create_chart(data, theme='custom')
# How do I adjust the spine thickness?
# How do I add a secondary y-axis with specific formatting?
# How do I position a legend outside the plot area precisely?

# You end up doing this:
ax = chart.get_underlying_axes()  # escape hatch
ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)  # back to matplotlib
# ... mixing two APIs becomes confusing
```

### AI Coding Agent Inefficiency

This is perhaps the most critical issue in modern development workflows. AI coding agents face significant challenges with wrapper libraries:

- **Training data scarcity**: Less popular libraries have fewer examples in training data
- **API uncertainty**: Agents may hallucinate non-existent methods or parameters
- **Internal behavior opacity**: Agents cannot reliably predict how wrappers transform their inputs
- **Version sensitivity**: Wrapper APIs change more frequently than matplotlib's stable core

### Dependency Anxiety

Users are often hesitant about third-party chart dependencies:

- What if the library is abandoned?
- What if an update breaks my existing code?
- Do I need to understand the entire codebase to use it safely?
- Can I debug issues without diving into unfamiliar source code?

**No one wants a dependency that requires understanding its entire internal codebase to use safely.**

## Why matplotlib Directly?

matplotlib is the foundation of Python visualization for good reasons:

### Predictable Behavior

matplotlib's API is well-documented and behaves consistently. When you write:

```python
ax.plot(x, y, color='red', linewidth=2)
ax.set_xlabel('Time [s]')
ax.set_xlim(0, 10)
```

You know exactly what will happen. There are no hidden transformations or automatic adjustments that might surprise you.

### Low-Level Control

Every aspect of your figure is accessible and adjustable:

```python
# Fine-grained control over every element
fig.subplots_adjust(left=0.15, right=0.95, top=0.9, bottom=0.15)
ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
ax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45, labelsize=8)
ax.annotate('Peak', xy=(5, 100), xytext=(6, 120),
            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'))
```

### Extensive Documentation and Community

- Comprehensive official documentation with thousands of examples
- Decades of Stack Overflow answers
- Established patterns that AI coding agents understand well
- Stable API that rarely introduces breaking changes

### Agent-Friendly Code

Because matplotlib is well-represented in AI training data, coding agents can:

- Generate correct matplotlib code reliably
- Understand and modify existing matplotlib code
- Debug matplotlib issues effectively
- Suggest optimizations based on established patterns

## The shadcn/ui Approach

dartwork-mpl draws inspiration from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), a revolutionary approach in the frontend world.

### The shadcn/ui Philosophy

shadcn/ui is not a traditional component library. Instead of installing a package and importing components, you **copy the component code into your project**. This gives you:

- Full ownership and control over the code
- No dependency version conflicts
- Freedom to modify without forking
- Components that are just starting points, not black boxes

### Ownable Code

dartwork-mpl utilities are designed to be **ownable**. Consider our `simple_layout` function:

```python
def simple_layout(
    fig: Figure,
    gs: GridSpec | None = None,
    margins: tuple[float, float, float, float] = (0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05),
    bbox: tuple[float, float, float, float] = (0, 1, 0, 1),
    ...
) -> OptimizeResult:
    """
    Optimize figure layout by adjusting GridSpec parameters.
    
    Uses scipy.optimize.minimize to find optimal margins.
    """
    if gs is None:
        gs = fig.axes[0].get_gridspec()
    
    def objective(x):
        gs.update(left=x[0], right=x[1], bottom=x[2], top=x[3])
        # Calculate bounding box and compare with targets
        ...
    
    result = minimize(objective, x0=initial_guess, bounds=bounds)
    return result
```

This function:
- Uses only standard libraries (scipy, matplotlib)
- Has no dartwork-mpl internal dependencies
- Can be copied directly into your project and modified
- Is completely transparent in its operation

### Copy-Paste Ready

Many dartwork-mpl utilities can be extracted and used standalone:

```python
# These can be copied into any project without dartwork-mpl

def cm2in(cm: float) -> float:
    """Convert centimeters to inches."""
    return cm / 2.54

def fs(n: int | float) -> float:
    """Return base font size + n."""
    return plt.rcParams["font.size"] + n

def mix_colors(color1, color2, alpha=0.5):
    """Mix two colors."""
    c1 = mcolors.to_rgb(color1)
    c2 = mcolors.to_rgb(color2)
    return tuple(alpha * a + (1 - alpha) * b for a, b in zip(c1, c2))
```

### Future: Pure matplotlib Export

We plan to add a feature that converts dartwork-mpl enhanced code back to pure matplotlib:

```python
# Your code with dartwork-mpl
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(dm.cm2in(9), dm.cm2in(7)))
ax.plot(x, y, color='oc.red5')
dm.simple_layout(fig)

# Exported pure matplotlib (planned feature)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(3.543, 2.756))  # cm2in(9), cm2in(7)
ax.plot(x, y, color='#ff6b6b')  # oc.red5 resolved
fig.subplots_adjust(left=0.15, right=0.95, ...)  # layout values baked in
```

---

## Design Principles

### Thin and Simple

Every utility should be as simple as possible:

```python
# Our approach: thin utility
def cm2in(cm: float) -> float:
    return cm / 2.54

# Not this: over-engineered abstraction
class UnitConverter:
    def __init__(self, source_unit, target_unit, precision=6):
        self.source = source_unit
        self.target = target_unit
        self.precision = precision
    
    def convert(self, value):
        # ... complex conversion logic
        pass
```

### Minimal Inter-Module Dependencies

Each utility should work independently:

```python
# Good: independent utilities
from dartwork_mpl import cm2in, fs, simple_layout
# Each function works without importing the others

# Avoid: tightly coupled modules where one requires many others
```

### Clarity Over Extensibility

We prioritize code that is easy to understand over code that handles every edge case:

```python
# Our approach: clear and focused
def fs(n: int | float) -> float:
    """Return base font size + n."""
    return plt.rcParams["font.size"] + n

# Not this: extensible but complex
def font_size(delta=0, unit='pt', relative_to='base', 
              min_size=None, max_size=None, scale_factor=1.0):
    # ... 50 lines of handling edge cases
    pass
```

### Utilities, Not Wrappers

dartwork-mpl provides utilities that **enhance** matplotlib, not wrappers that **replace** it:

```python
# Wrapper approach (what we avoid):
dm_figure = dm.Figure(width=9, height=7, unit='cm')
dm_figure.plot(x, y, style='modern')
dm_figure.save('output.png')

# Our approach: utilities alongside standard matplotlib
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(dm.cm2in(9), dm.cm2in(7)))  # utility
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax.plot(x, y, color='oc.red5')  # extended color names
dm.simple_layout(fig)  # utility
fig.savefig('output.png')  # standard matplotlib
```

---

## dartwork-mpl in Practice

### You're Still Writing matplotlib

With dartwork-mpl, your code remains fundamentally matplotlib code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import dartwork_mpl as dm
import numpy as np

# Apply style (sets rcParams, nothing more)
dm.style.use('scientific')

# Standard matplotlib figure creation
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(dm.cm2in(9), dm.cm2in(7)), dpi=200)
gs = fig.add_gridspec(nrows=1, ncols=1,
                      left=0.17, right=0.95, top=0.95, bottom=0.17)
ax = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0])

# Standard matplotlib plotting
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
ax.plot(x, np.sin(x), color='oc.red5', linewidth=0.7)  # only color is extended
ax.set_xlabel('Time [s]')
ax.set_ylabel('Amplitude')
ax.legend(fontsize=dm.fs(-1))  # utility for relative font size

# Utility for layout optimization
dm.simple_layout(fig)

# Standard matplotlib or utility for saving
dm.save_and_show(fig)
```

Every line is recognizable matplotlib. The dartwork-mpl additions are clearly utilities, not replacements.

### Minimal Learning Curve

To use dartwork-mpl effectively, you need:

1. **matplotlib knowledge** (which you likely already have)
2. **A few utility functions**: `cm2in`, `fs`, `fw`, `simple_layout`, `save_and_show`
3. **Color name extensions**: `oc.*`, `tw.*` prefixes

That's it. No new plotting paradigm to learn.

### Vibe Coding and AI Assistance

dartwork-mpl is designed for modern AI-assisted development workflows:

**Context prompts over predefined functions**: Instead of memorizing a library of specialized plot functions, you can describe what you want to an AI coding agent:

```
"Create a publication-quality line plot with two y-axes, 
use dartwork-mpl's scientific style, and optimize the layout"
```

The agent can generate correct code because:
- The underlying matplotlib API is well-known
- dartwork-mpl utilities are simple and well-documented
- There are no hidden behaviors to account for

**Efficient collaboration with AI agents**:

```python
# AI agents can reliably generate this because it's standard matplotlib
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(dm.cm2in(12), dm.cm2in(8)))
ax.plot(data['x'], data['y'], color='oc.blue5', label='Measurement')
ax.fill_between(data['x'], data['y_low'], data['y_high'], 
                color='oc.blue2', alpha=0.3, label='Confidence')
ax.set_xlabel('Time [hours]')
ax.set_ylabel('Temperature [°C]')
ax.legend(loc='upper right', fontsize=dm.fs(-1))
dm.simple_layout(fig)
```

### No Black Boxes

When something doesn't work as expected, you can:

1. **Inspect the utility source**: Our utilities are short and readable
2. **Debug with standard tools**: Everything is matplotlib under the hood
3. **Copy and modify**: Extract the utility, adjust it for your needs
4. **Skip the utility entirely**: Use pure matplotlib if preferred

## Summary

dartwork-mpl is built on these core beliefs:

| Traditional Wrappers | dartwork-mpl |
|---------------------|--------------|
| New API to learn | matplotlib API + thin utilities |
| Hidden transformations | Transparent operations |
| Dependency on library internals | Copy-paste ready code |
| AI agents struggle with unfamiliar APIs | AI agents work efficiently with familiar matplotlib |
| "What does this function do internally?" | "I can read and understand the source in 30 seconds" |

**Our goal**: matplotlib knowledge + minimal dartwork-mpl familiarity = publication-quality visualizations with efficient AI assistance.

We believe the best library is one you could stop using tomorrow—by simply copying the utilities you need into your own codebase.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Using uv (Recommended)

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast Python package installer and resolver. To install `dartwork-mpl` with uv:

```shell
# Add to your project
uv add git+https://github.com/dartworklabs/dartwork-mpl

# Or install directly
uv pip install git+https://github.com/dartworklabs/dartwork-mpl
```

#### Using pip

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/dartworklabs/dartwork-mpl
```

### Quick Start

After installation, import and apply a style preset:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import dartwork_mpl as dm

# Apply scientific publication style
dm.style.use('scientific')

# For Korean text support
dm.style.use('scientific-kr')
```
<br/>


## Core Features

### Style Management
- **Preset Styles**: Ready-to-use presets for scientific papers, presentations, and reports
- **Flexible Customization**: Combine individual styles for fine-grained control
- **Korean Language Support**: Built-in Korean font support with `-kr` presets

### Color System
- **dartwork-mpl Colors**: Custom color palette with `oc.red5`, `oc.blue2`, etc.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Full Tailwind palette with `tw.blue500`, `tw.gray200`, etc.
- **Color Utilities**: Mix colors and apply pseudo-transparency

### Layout & Utilities
- **Smart Layout Optimization**: `simple_layout()` replaces `tight_layout()` with better control
- **Unit Conversion**: `cm2in()` for precise figure sizing
- **Multi-format Export**: Save figures in SVG, PNG, PDF, and EPS simultaneously
- **Font Utilities**: Relative font size (`fs()`) and weight (`fw()`) adjustments

### Visualization Tools
- **Colormap Explorer**: Preview and classify colormaps by type
- **Color Palette Viewer**: Display all available colors with names
- **Font Gallery**: Preview available fonts

<br/>


## Example Usage

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import dartwork_mpl as dm

# Set style
dm.style.use('scientific')

# Create figure with precise sizing (single-column paper figure)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(dm.cm2in(9), dm.cm2in(7)), dpi=200)

# Set up layout
gs = fig.add_gridspec(nrows=1, ncols=1,
                      left=0.17, right=0.95,
                      top=0.95, bottom=0.17)
ax = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0])

# Plot with custom colors
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
ax.plot(x, np.sin(x), c='oc.red5', lw=0.7, label='Sin')
ax.plot(x, np.cos(x), c='tw.blue500', lw=0.7, label='Cos')

# Customize
ax.set_xlabel('X value')
ax.set_ylabel('Y value')
ax.legend(fontsize=dm.fs(-1))

# Optimize layout and save
dm.simple_layout(fig)
dm.save_and_show(fig)  # Display in Jupyter

# Export in multiple formats
dm.save_formats(fig, 'output/figure',
                formats=('svg', 'png', 'pdf', 'eps'),
                dpi=600)
```

## AI-Assisted Development

dartwork-mpl provides an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that enables AI coding assistants like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Code to automatically access the latest dartwork-mpl documentation and guidelines.

### Why Use MCP?

- **Automatic access**: AI assistants can directly access the latest dartwork-mpl documentation
- **No manual updates**: Documentation updates are automatically available to your AI assistant
- **Seamless integration**: Works seamlessly with Cursor and other MCP-compatible AI assistants
- **Always up-to-date**: Your AI assistant always has access to the latest library information

### Setup Instructions

To use dartwork-mpl's MCP server with Cursor, add the following configuration to your MCP settings file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dartwork-mpl": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/dartworklabs/dartwork-mpl.git#egg=dartwork-mpl[mcp]",
        "mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

After adding this configuration, your AI assistant will have automatic access to dartwork-mpl's documentation and guidelines.
